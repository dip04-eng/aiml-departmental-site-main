It began operations in the academic year 2020–2021. The main goal of this department is to teach fundamental ideas like computational thinking, object-oriented programming, data structures, algorithms, machine learning, deep learning, database management systems, artificial intelligence (including search strategies and knowledge representation), natural language processing, and Python programming for problem-solving. As a result, students will have a thorough understanding of artificial intelligence and machine learning through the application of real-world issues in a wide range of application domains, including speech and natural language processing, computer vision, cognitive sciences, and others. Throughout their studies, students will get expertise in a variety of professional electives given by machine learning, computer vision, voice and natural language processing, data analytics, cyber security, blockchain, cloud computing and generative AI domain verticals.";
